# My Wix Portfolio - SIT253 Final Project

As part of the **SIT253** unit at Deakin University, I decided to create a portfolio website using **Wix**. The goal was to learn how to use Wix while combining my previous web design skills in a creative way. This portfolio showcases my work in **Blender** and other related projects, demonstrating my growth as a designer and developer.
